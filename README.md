Simple Javascript by Pkrll

### JavaScript
Here will be a collection of simple Javascript plugins and snippets. Nothing fancy, just a coding sandbox, but that hopefully will be to use to someone, somewhere, somewhen.

### ProgressBar.js
Create HTML5 progress bar elements with the ProgressBar plugin, that will display the progress of tasks like uploads, downloads and other functions involving progress.

### More to come?
Perhaps. Maybe. Probably. Or not.
